- Intro
  Me, Softwire, Security is a big deal, not just about your code, etc

- Heartbleed? 
  Everything breaks. Complicated old things particularly
  Static analysis good, unsafe languages bad
  http://opensslrampage.org
  Tarsnap safe, because it was well isolated

- Apache 
  Holes anywhere can break *everything*

- Rails
  User input is dangerous
  Data formats are dangerous (complexity again)
  Postel's Law!

- PHP
  Testing and best practices are important!

- Postgres
  Isolating your system from itself keeps everything independently secure
  Exposing your internals makes all of this possible

- Github OAuth?
  Tricky for time, but good overall example of why all the isolation etc above is important

- Conclusion
